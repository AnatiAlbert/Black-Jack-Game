## The deck is unlimited in size.
## There are no jokers.
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.

## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
#cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]

    '''Take a list of cards and return the score calculated from the cards'''
    score = sum(list_cards)
    if score == 21 and len(list_cards) == 2:
        return 0
    if 11 in list_cards and score > 21:
        list_cards.remove(11)
        list_cards.append(1)

    elif user_score == 0:
        return 'Won, with a Blackjack!'

        return 'You went over, you lost!'
    elif computer_score > 21:
